# Images

Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download. You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages.

First you need to determine the sizes of images that will be used commonly throughout the site, then give each size a name. For example: small medium large Where the  elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes you can use these names as values for the class attribute. In the CSS, you add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions

## Background-image

The background-image property allows us to place an image behind any HTML element.

* repeat
* repeat-x : The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
* repeat-y: The image is repeated vertically only.
