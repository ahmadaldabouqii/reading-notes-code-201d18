# HTML-Lists
* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

<br>

* <ol\>

    The ordered list is created with
    the <ol\> element.

* <li\>

    Each item in the list is placed
    between an opening <li\> tag
    and a closing </li\> tag. (The li
    stands for list item.)

## Unordered Lists

* <ul\>

    The unordered list is created
    with the <ul\> element.

* <li\>

    Each item in the list is placed
    between an opening <li\> tag
    and a closing </li\> tag. (The li
    stands for list item.)

## Definition Lists

* <dl\>

    The definition list is created with
    the <dl\> element and usually
    consists of a series of terms and
    their definitions.
    Inside the <dl\> element you will
    usually see pairs of <dt\> and
    <dd\> elements.

* <dt\>

    This is used to contain the term
    being defined (the definition
    term).

* <dd\>

    This is used to contain the
    definition.

## Nested Lists

You can put a second list inside
an <li\> element to create a sublist or nested list.
Browsers display nested lists
indented further than the parent
list. In nested unordered lists,
the browser will usually change
the style of the bullet point too.

> There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.

> Ordered lists use numbers.

> Unordered lists use bullets.

> Definition lists are used to define terminology.

> Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Border, Margin & Padding

1) Border 

    Every box has a border (even if
    it is not visible or is specified to
    be 0 pixels wide). The border
    separates the edge of one box
    from another.

2) Margin

    Margins sit outside the edge
    of the border. You can set the
    width of a margin to create a
    gap between the borders of two
    adjacent boxes.

3) Padding

    Padding is the space between
    the border of a box and any
    content contained within it.
    Adding padding can increase the
    readability of its contents.

## CSS3: Border Images

> border-image
    The border-image property
    applies an image to the border of
    any box. It takes a background
    image and slices it into nine
    pieces.

> CSS3: Box Shadows box-shadow
The box-shadow property
allows you to add a drop shadow
around a box. It works just like
the text-shadow property that
you met on page 288. It must
use at least the first of these two
values as well as a color:

> Horizontal offset

    Negative values position the
    shadow to the left of the box.

> Vertical offset

    Negative values position the
    shadow to the top of the box.

> Blur distance

    If omitted, the shadow is a solid
    line like a border.

> Spread of shadow

    If used, a positive value will
    cause the shadow to expand in
    all directions, and a negative
    value will make it contract.

## CSS3: Rounded Corners

> border-radius
    CSS3 introduces the ability to
    create rounded corners on any
    box, using a property called
    border-radius. The value
    indicates the size of the radius
    in pixels.

## ARRAY

<hr>

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

## SWITCH STATEMENTS 
<hr>

A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.

## USING DO WHILE LOOPS 
<hr>

The key difference between
a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e
loop is that the statements in
the code block come before the
condition. This means that those
statements are run once whether
or not the condition is met.

If you take a look at the
condition, it is checking that the
value of the variable called i is
less than 1, but that variable has
already been set to a value of 1.

Therefore, in this example the
result is that the 5 times table is
written out once, even though
the counter is not less than 1.

> There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
