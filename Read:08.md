# Key Concepts in Positioning Elements 

## Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

## Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a

(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation). The
element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
 

## Controlling the Position of Elements

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

## SHORT SUMMARY OF LAYOUT

> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

> Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

> The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

> Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

> Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

> CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

> You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
