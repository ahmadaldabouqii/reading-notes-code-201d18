# LINKS

## Writing Links

Links are created using the <a\> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a\> tag and the closing </a\> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Email Links

> mailto:

To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a\>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

## Opening Links in a New Window

> target

If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a\> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

> Links are created using the <a\> element.

> The <a\> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.

> If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

> You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

> You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# JAVA Script

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
